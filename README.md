# BitBadges Improvement Proposals (BBIPs)

The goal of the BBIP project is to standardize and provide high-quality documentation for BitBadges itself and conventions built upon it. This repository tracks past and ongoing improvements to BitBadges in the form of BitBadges Improvement Proposals (BBIPs). This repository was forked from Ethereum's EIPs, and we aim to follow the same standards and processes as Ethereum but for BitBadges.

**Before you write a BBIP, ideas MUST be well thought-out and thoroughly discussed.**

Please note that this repository is for documenting standards and not for help implementing them. For other questions and concerns regarding BBIPs, please contact us.
